CNCF Cloud Native Definition:
>Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.


## Learning Journey
Access the learning modules [https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/learning-cloudnative-101/](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/learning-cloudnative-101/).

This learning journey will get you started into Cloud Native, covering many basic concepts with hands-on labs. The journey takes you through frameworks, programming models, building a 12-factor application, containers, Kubernetes, migrating an application from Cloud Foundry to Kubernetes, Helm templating, DevOps, Continous Integration (CI), and Continous Deployment (CD).
