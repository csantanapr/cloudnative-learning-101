# Contributing Guide

## Running site in development mode

To run the site in development mode you need to have https://nodejs.org/en/[npm] installed with https://nodejs.org[nodejs] v10.x or above. 

After cloning the repositories, you can run `npm install` from the root directory of the repository to install needed nodejs packages.

Start the development site using `npm run dev` command, this should open a local development site in http://localhost:3000. 

Making any changes to your local repositories above cloned earlier, will be automatically built and the development site gets reloaded automatically.
